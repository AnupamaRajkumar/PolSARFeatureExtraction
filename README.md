# ProcessChainForPolSARFeature
Hancrafted and shallow deep neural network for PolSAR feature extraction.\
Handcrafted features:\
1. SAR polarimetric features - Pauli decomposition, Krogager decomposition, Freeman-Durden decomposition, Cloude and Pottier decomposition
2. Texture based features - GLCM and LBP
3. Color based features - MPEG-7
4. Morphological features - opening and closing
5. Shallow deep neural network - Autoencoder

# Results - Oberpfaffenhofen dataset
